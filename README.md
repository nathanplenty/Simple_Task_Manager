# Task Manager Backend Development

In the section "Backend Development: Implementation of API Endpoints and Integration with the Database", you are tasked with creating the functionality of the API endpoints that allow interaction with the Task Manager application. This includes creating functions or methods that respond to HTTP requests and perform corresponding actions.

Here are the specific steps you should take:

## Implementation of API Endpoints
Create functions or methods in PHP that respond to various HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These functions should enable CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.

## Integration with the Database
Connect your PHP application to the database where the task data will be stored. You can use a lightweight database like SQLite as it is easy to implement. Ensure that your PHP functions execute the appropriate SQL queries to manipulate the database accordingly.

## Testing of API Endpoints
Verify the correct functionality of your API endpoints by testing them with various HTTP requests, for example, using a tool like Postman. Ensure that the endpoints deliver the expected results and that the data is correctly stored in the database.

## Error Handling
Implement error handling in your code to handle unexpected situations, such as invalid requests or database errors. Ensure that your API returns appropriate error messages to provide feedback to the user.

In summary, you are tasked with developing the backend logic that enables the Task Manager application to communicate with the database via API requests and perform CRUD operations for tasks.
